# Lessons Learned
## Architecture
* Where is what?
	* What external libraries do I need?
	* Where does the logic go in my apps, what files do I need to define?
	
* Who is responsible for what?
	* What do the files above do? What are their responsabilities?

## Comparison to the angularjs Router
* What does it do better?
* What is not possible?

## Chanlenges in Flux
* What could be the problems in Flux?

## What do I dislike?
* Does anything feel like a Hack?
The one thing that disturbes me the most is the fact that there does not seem to fit with flux 100%, I would like the router to create an Action. Maybe there are ways to do this, but I have not found any solution now. I have heard people saying that the router is already like a store, the url is the state. But I still do not like the idea of the router deciding what elements to render. It seems that it has a lot more responsabilities than a store... But then again I do not have any better ideas :/.
