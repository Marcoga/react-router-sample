# react-router-sample
In order to deep a little deeper into react, I will need some form of client-side-routing. I am interested in using react in combination with Flux. I want to evaluate the use of the routers available before settling on a router. 

## Goals
1. Understand how to use the react-router
2. Understand what the heck nested routes actually mean
3. How do I handle redirects, transitions, Authentication

## Non Goals
1. react-router for Flux (will create own repo for this). 
2. Reuse of the code

## Pre-requisites
* [Node] (http://nodejs.org) 
* [Gulp] (http://gulpjs.com)

### Install Gulp
```
$ npm install --global gulp
```

## Build
```
npm install
gulp build-all
```
